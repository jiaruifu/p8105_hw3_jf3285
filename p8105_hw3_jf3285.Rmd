```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1
This problem uses the Instacart data.
```{r Instacart}
library(p8105.datasets)
cart_data = 
  data("instacart") 
cart_data





```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
